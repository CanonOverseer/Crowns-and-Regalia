  Adds 3 Crowns to the game, fit for an Emperor of your Colony
  great for your medieval or Royalty playthrough

  (NEW) They now are able to be spawned as Relics, I've also adjusted a few stats

  They require the the Royal Clothing Research if you have Royalty and Smithing if you don't

  all have a stuffable variant and a normal variant.
  current crowns include:

  ~ the Reichskrone (Crown of the Holy Roman Empire)
  ~ the Byzantine Crown (Crown of the Eastern Roman / Byzantine Empire under the Komnenos Dynasty)
  ~ the Emerald Crown


  Stats and stuff are based off of the stellic crown, so if you have better stat suggestions, feel free to tell me.
